A small program to demonstrate & explore basic memory allocation in an operating system. This program is not optimized in anyway.

I explored the following memory allocation algorithms: first, best, next & worst.
The results of this can be found in report.txt.





The Usage of the program is as follows
./memswap -f inputfile.txt -a algorithm -m memory_size
(initials are used for algorithms)

Example Usage
./memswap -f testcase/given/m200_in.txt -a b -m 200
./memswap -f testcase/given/m300_in.txt -a f -m 300
